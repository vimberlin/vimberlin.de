Our first beginners workshop in [August 2012](/august-2012-workshop) was a huge success. Around twenty people were learning something new: Some of them learned the usage of the `vimrc`, others went through [vimtutor](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/vimtutor1.html), and some of them asked specific questions.

I'm happy to announce the second vimberlin beginners workshop.

### Recap

This time we had fewer people at out workshop since last time: 5 males, 1 female, and three coaches. We changed the format of this workshop a little bit more and make it more like a talk about the main concepts and features of Vim with interactive questions of the audience. Other coaches trained new people to Vim individually as we went together through the **vimtutor**. Again, we got huge positive feedback for our workshop and will try newer things in the future to make it better.

Our coach [Sven](https://twitter.com/guckes) was so nice to put a resume of the last meetup [online](http://www.guckes.net/vimberlin/2012-10-25.notes.txt).
