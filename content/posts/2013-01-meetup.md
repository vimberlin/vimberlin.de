## Recap

We were around sixteen people this time from over four different countries. Apparently, the first talk by Johannes Kulick about using your desktop as if it would be Vim wasn't held because Johannes was there.


Matthias presented his talk about using `vim-slime` plugin and we gave him a big Vim-Hug for Jonathan, the inventor of the plugin. You can find the slides on [speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/wikimatze/vim-slime).


After presenting the "vim-slime", [Niels Madan](https://twitter.com/nielsmadan)) explained a plugin he is going to install as a replacement of the vim slime plugin. It is still in development but you can find a video here:

Our last talk was by held by [Federico Galassi](https://twitter.com/federicogalassi). He was talking about using Vimgolf and why he doesn't do it any longer. You can watch the following video
