We currently have two talks on our agenda:

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>"Multiediting"</strong>
    <br>
    Since Sublime Text became popular, a lot of people have been trying to replicate its "multiple cursors" functionality in Vim. Fortunately for us Vim-users, our editor doesn't really need this, since we have built-in ways to achieve pretty much the same results. Still, I believe the multi-edit plugins have some interesting properties and I want to demonstrate them and some of their benefits and drawbacks. I'll also talk about :substitute, :global and the dot mapping and share some tips and tricks that make them a simple alternative to multiple cursors. I'll finish up with demos of some of my own hacky experiments on this topic.

## Recap

After a three month break it was great to see so many new faces and that our community is growing slowly.

We recorded two of the three talks:
