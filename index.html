Recap: First Meetup - 2012-01-26
--------------------------------

Thank you all for coming. It was a great evening and I had a lot of fun. I'm
especially proud, that so many of you guys showed up. I think we were about 20
people. I think, that's pretty impressive for a first meeting.

I would like to thank <a href="http://drewneil.com/"
                >Drew</a> for his thoughts on plugins and how they fit into the
Vim universe. Also, playing some <a
href="http://vimgolf.com/">vimgolf</a> was both entertaining and illuminating.

Afterwards we were talking about our favourite plugins. I hope, we can still
collect a list of all of them here for future reference. See the article above
for more detail.

Finally we talked about vimberlin itself. We've settled to meet on the 4th
Thursday of every odd month. So the next meetup will be on


    March 22nd 2012 - 8 p.m. again at LAUNCH/CO


We are starting to using a mailing list to discuss talk proposals and other
stuff. (There is a link at the top of the page.) I've also added a link to an
iCal feed containing the schedule for the next meetups.

I'll continue to use the Twitter account <a
    href="http://twitter.com/vimberlin">vimberlin</a> for announcements and
things of (potentially) general interest.


Thanks Jan and LAUNCH/CO for hosting the event and providing us with chairs,
beers and beamer and thank you all for making vimberlin happen.

Gregor







Announcement: First Meetup - 2012-01-26 - 08:00 p.m.
----------------------------------------------------

The first vimberlin user group meetup will take place on Thursday, 26th January,
at 8:00 p.m at the <a
href="https://launchco.com/etc/#coworking">LAUNCH/CO coworking space</a> (<a
href="http://g.co/maps/k62eb">map</a>).


Topics for our first meetup will be:

<a href="http://drewneil.com/">Drew Neil</a> (aka <a
href="http://twitter.com/nelstrom">@nelstrom</a>), the creator of the awesome <a
href="http://vimcasts.org/">vimcasts</a>, agreed to give a
talk. We are very proud to have him at our very first meetup. The topic is yet
to be announced.


Further topics will be kind of organizational. We should briefly talk about:

* Expectations for this user group
* Future schedule for regular meetups
* Future topics of meetups


We will have some time at the end for small talk and socializing. Also, in
Friedrichshain, it should be rather easy to move on to a bar after the meetup.


Feel free to let us know, that you are coming, by leaving your name in <a
