## Talks

- **"Andrew's guide to the NERDTree"** by [Andrew Radev](https://twitter.com/andrewradev)<br>
The [NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) is one of the most powerful Vim plugins up to date. And because of its many features, I feel that most people don't use it to its full potential. Stuff like precise node-by-node navigation, bookmarks, manipulating the file system, and, the most fun part of all, support for plugins.<br> <br> Since I consider myself a NERDTree power user, I'd like to demonstrate some of these and show off a few personal customizations that I've built to improve my workflow. I'll touch on some of the alternatives, but for the most part, I'll try to convince you that the NERDTree is an excellent tool to have in your toolbox.
