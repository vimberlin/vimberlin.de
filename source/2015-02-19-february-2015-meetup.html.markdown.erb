## Talks

- **"Vim Plug - my favorite plugin manager"** by [Matthias GÃ¼nther](https://twitter.com/wikimatze)<br>
In our [January 2015 Meetup](/january-2015-meetup/ "January 2015 Meetup") we talked about the way to use
plugin managers for Vim. I will go through [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug "vim-plug")
and tell you why it's the best plugin manager for vim in the world.
- **"Configure Vim with Nix"** by [Rok Garbas](https://twitter.com/garbas "Rok Garbas")


## Open Topics

We are going to take time to answer questions related to vim - feel free to prepare them.

Beside we will have an open discussions about tools for [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ "Ruby") and
[Rails development](http://rubyonrails.org/ "Rails development").

### Highlighting SQL in heredoc parts in Ruby


All credit for this goes to [AndrewRadev](https://github.com/AndrewRadev/Vimfiles/blob/master/after/syntax/ruby.vim "AndrewRadev"):


```vim
let s:bcs = b:current_syntax
unlet b:current_syntax
syntax include @SQL syntax/sql.vim
let b:current_syntax = s:bcs

" match optional, surrounding single or double quote and any whitespace in the heredoc name
syntax region rubyHereDocSQL matchgroup=rubyOperator start=+<<-\?\(['"]\?\)\z(\s*SQL\s*\)\1+ end=+^\s*\z1$+ contains=@SQL
```

It's the best to put this in `after/syntax/ruby.vim`


### smapclear

This removes all mapping when you are in `Select` mode (used for) - very handy for snippet completion. Put this option in `after/plugin/smapclear.vim`. Thanks [AndrewRadev](https://github.com/AndrewRadev/ "AndrewRadev") for this tip.
