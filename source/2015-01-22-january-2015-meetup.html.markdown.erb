## Talks

- **"Git and Vim - maximize the joy and fun"** by [Matthias GÃ¼nther](https://twitter.com/wikimatze)<br>
Follow me through my travel exploring the way to get Vim and Git running in a friendly coexistence.
- **"Switch.vim and clever regexes"** by [Andrew Radev](https://twitter.com/andrewradev "Andrew Radev")<br>
I'll talk a bit about my "switch" plugin, why I made it and why I think it's a useful tool, even if it is a bit simple. I'll show you some of the clever regexes I've used in it (that you might not know about), and I'll ask you for feedback on how to make the plugin even better :)


## Vim News

Andrew will share the latest news about Vim and other parts of it.
