We will have our first book club about [Ben Klein's](https://twitter.com/fifthposition "Ben Klein") book [The VimL Primer: Edit Like a Pro with Vim Plugins and Scripts](https://pragprog.com/book/bkviml/the-viml-primer "The VimL Primer: Edit Like a Pro with Vim Plugins and Scripts"). If you want to get started scripting your own Vim plugins or learn something new, then this book might be a good start:


> Build on your editorâ€™s capabilities and tailor your editing experience with VimL, the powerful scripting language built into Vim. With VimL you can configure basic settings or add entirely new functionality. Use this quick and easy introduction to create your own Vim plugin while learning the concepts and syntax of VimL.


You will get a 35% coupon code. Just write me a pm under [@vimberlin](http://twitter.com/vimberlin "@vimberlin").


We will talk about this book in our March Meetup. Having questions, ideas or if
you want to report your progress through the book, please [share your knowledge with us](https://groups.google.com/group/vimberlin/ "share your knowledge with us").
