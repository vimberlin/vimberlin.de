Hi,

come and join us for last meetup in 2017. This will be no normal meetup (no talks, no laptops).


We will meet around 6PM at the food court of the Mall of Berlin from the Leipziger Platz on the second floor in front
of the Subway store (https://www.mallofberlin.de/start/stores/subway) and after dinner we will go to the sneak preview @Cinestar Potsdamer
Platz from 8 - 10PM (http://www.cinestar.de/de/kino/berlin-cinestar-original-im-sony-center). Please check where you
want to join us. No, we don't know which movie will be played - that's why it's called "sneak preview".

Interested? Make your check under the doodle https://doodle.com/poll/449gge3m3q7yu78r.


Your host will be [Sven Guckes (@guckes)](http://www.guckes.net "Sven Guckes") & [Matthias Guenther
(@wikimatze)](https://wikimatze.de/ "Matthias Guenther (@wikimatze)")

See you there!
