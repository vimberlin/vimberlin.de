Dear Vim users,

the next meetup is soon. Did you discover a new plugin, learned something about Vim, found a fancy shortcut key or just used Vim
for developing a cool project -- we want to hear about it!


Interested? We are always interested in short-talks, longer talks as well as presentations about what you've learned. Please post your proposal under
[GitHub](https://github.com/vimberlin/vimberlin.de/issues/33 "GitHub").


## The rest

Bring your laptops - and join the fun! And show us *your* use with Vim! Be brief.. 5min for each presentation. We are
open to any kind of questions and suggestions.


Your host will be [Sven Guckes a.k.a. @guckes](http://www.guckes.net "Sven Guckes") & [Matthias Guenther
a.k.a @wikimatze](http://wikimatze.de/ "Matthias Guenther (@wikimatze)")


See you there!
