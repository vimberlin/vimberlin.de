## Discussions

Luckily, [Andrew](https://twitter.com/andrewradev) was so kind to post us some ideas we can talk about:


- [projectile](https://github.com/tpope/vim-projectionist) - Projections are maps from file names and globs to sets of properties describing the file
- [vimrc from chiphogg](https://github.com/chiphogg/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc)
- [vim-multiuser](https://github.com/emgram769/vim-multiuser) - collaborate with others on realtime on the same file
  (bring your laptops with you so that we can try it out)
