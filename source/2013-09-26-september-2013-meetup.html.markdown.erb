## We have two talks on our agenda:



* **"Browsing a codebase with ctags"** by [Matthias GÃ¼nther](https://twitter.com/wikimatze)

    I was always asking myself how I can browse a code base of bigger written ruby library. I want to share with you
    what I did and what my current work flow looks like. [See sources here](https://bitbucket.org/wikimatze/presentations/src/74438bf5788e85c15f04e4e36faa3aae2da703d2/slides.markdown?at=vim-autocompletion) and [See slides here](/data/vimberlin-2013-09_ctags.html)

* **"Profiling Vim"** by [Florian Eitel](http://feitel.indeedgeek.de/)
