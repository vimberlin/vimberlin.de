## Talks

- **"Vim Banshee - a command line wrapper for Banshee"** by [Matthias Günther](https://twitter.com/wikimatze)<br>
Based on [Ben Klein's](https://twitter.com/fifthposition) book [The VimL Primer: Edit Like a Pro with Vim Plugins and Scripts](https://pragprog.com/book/bkviml/the-viml-primer) I started to write this plugin and I want to go through it and explain it.
- **Vim lookup** by [Gernot Höflechner](https://github.com/LFDM "Gernot Höflechner")<br>
Gernot will give a shor talk about his [vim-lookup](https://github.com/LFDM/vim-lookup "vim-lookup")  plugin which make it easy to find certain files or directories very fast.


After the talks there will be a F&Q and free tools session.

See you all soon.
