We will gather around 7pm at the office and will start with the talks around 7.30pm.

## We have one talk on our agenda:


* **"Using Vimperator to browse the Web"** by [Matthias Günther](https://twitter.com/wikimatze)

    I switched over to Vimperator one month ago and would like to show you shortcuts and how you can configure it.


If you want to give a talk too, just send us a tweet or a mail.
