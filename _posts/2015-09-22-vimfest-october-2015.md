Vimfest Berlin 2015 is the first community-driven [Vim] "[Hackathon]", happening
the weekend of 10 – 11 October at [ThoughtWorks] in Berlin, organized by the
[Vim Berlin] user group and Vim enthusiasts from other cities.

We will spend the whole weekend on topics around the popular editor, such as:
efficient ways of writing with Vim. Setting up `.vimrc`. Using plugins that
rock, and writing plugins that rock. And also: other useful tools with vim
keybindings, like `mutt` or `newsbeuter`. What ever you're interested in:
Vimfest Berlin is an open space, everything is up to you!

So don't hesitate, and save the date: **10 – 11 October** in Berlin: Be with us
and join the very first Vimfest – try, learn and talk about the editor we all
love.

Ain't enough? Wait, there's more.

Berlin is a great place that has a lot to offer. Once having many Vim lovers
and interested people united at one place, we'll use the opportunity and,
guided by our locals, go find some of the most interesting buffers of Berlin
and celebrate Vim a bit at Saturday night.

## Schedule

Here is the rough agenda:

- present the projects to work on,
- jump into the projects,
- present learnings and results.

There is enough time to chat, relax in the garden and socialize with other
people. We will have drinks, wifi, a beamer - you can bring our own food there
(there is a small cuisine), restaurants are around the corner.

The best way to get things done is to sit together and work on things with a
limited amount of time. No time pressure or will to reach a goal - explore and
try out new things. Let's have a great time together! Let's have a great time
together!
