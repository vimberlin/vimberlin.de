## Next meetup is something special: "VIM NOVICE - a beginners workshop for people new to Vim" 2012-08-29, 7 p.m. at LAUNCH/CO

After discussing with [@lucapette](https://twitter.com/lucapette) and [@guckes](https://twitter.com/guckes) on our last meetup, we
brainstormed the ideas how we can teach Vim not only to basic users of the editor but as well to beginners who has never used a
modal editor like Vim before.


We will have three coaches:

     minutes to use another shell then <i>bash</i>.
