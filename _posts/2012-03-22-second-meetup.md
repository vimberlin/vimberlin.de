# Recap

First of all: Thank you all for coming, thanks to the two Matthiases for preparing and giving a talk and thanks to LAUNCH/CO for having us.

The slides of Matthias Günther's talk "Lessons learned with Vimscript" may be found [at Speakerdeck](http://speakerdeck.com/u/wikimatze/p/lessons-learned-with-vimscript). Matthias Viehweger's talk was more ad-hoc a.k.a. lightning talk style, and he did not use slides. So if you are interested in his introduction to [rails.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails) and the [Vim dbext plugin](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=356) you need to ask him in person.

We've again had lots of interesting discussions about folding, navigation and other Vim best practices. In this context Matthias Günther mentioned his [tocdown plugin](https://github.com/matthias-guenther/tocdown "tocdown plugin"), Drew Neil mentioned his [syntax highlighting for Markdown](https://github.com/nelstrom/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/ftplugin/markdown/folding.vim), the [vimoutliner](https://github.com/nelstrom/dotfiles/tree/master/vim/bundle/vimoutliner) and gave a quick explanation why he favors the default [netrw file browser](http://vimcasts.org/e/15) over plugins like [NERDtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree).

We will meet again on May 24th, 8 p.m. at the LAUNCH/CO coworking space. We would be glad, if you send talk proposals the mailing list.

I encourage you to send pull request to the [vimberlin GitHub repository](https://github.com/vimberlin/vimberlin.de) and add anything, that I might have missed.
Again, thanks for coming and making vimberlin happen. I've had great fun and learned a lot. I hope to see you all in May.
