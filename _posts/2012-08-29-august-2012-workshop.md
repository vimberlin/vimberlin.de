title: August 2012 - VIM NOVICE - a beginners workshop for people new to Vim
---

## Next meetup is something special: "VIM NOVICE - a beginners workshop for people new to Vim" 2012-08-29, 7 p.m. at LAUNCH/CO

After discussing with [@lucapette](https://twitter.com/lucapette) and [@guckes](https://twitter.com/guckes) on our last meetup, we
brainstormed the ideas how we can teach Vim not only to basic users of the editor but as well to beginners who has never used a
modal editor like Vim before.


We will have three coaches:

### Schedule:

- Get to know each other - tell us something about yourself and what editors you have used in the past.
- Tell what you want to learn (or what you already know) and we will start.
- Find more about the topic under our [wiki](https://github.com/vimberlin/vimberlin.de/wiki/vimberlin-workshop-for-newbies "wiki").

If you are interested, please sign under [evenbrite](http://vimberlin-eorg.eventbrite.com/ "eventbrite") and [lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2012/vimberlin-2-august/ "lanyrd") we have place for 12 students. It would be nice if you already installed Vim on your operation system so that we can right start without any bigger technical problems. You can find the installation instruction for [Vim here](http://www.vim.org/download.php "Vim installation).

If you have any questions, please contact <mailto:vimberlin@gmail.com>.

## Recap - 04/09/2012

Thousands thanks to all the attendees, our coaches ([@lucapette](https://twitter.com/lucapette), [@guckes](https://twitter.com/guckes),
and [@wikimatze](https://twitter.com/wikimatze), and {% include launch_co_link.html %} to make this event happen. We got a
huge amount of positive feedback to keep up with this event - we will go on with and would like to enhance your Vim abilities.

Later on the evening we talked about the timeframe of the next meeting. This would normally be in October but some of you
suggested to do this kind of workshop every two weeks to keep the learning and memorizing of commands. I'm not able to be a coach
this often.

The ones who want more frequent meetups may discuss things on the {% include mailing_list.html %} and on {% include twitter_link.html %} - if you have found a date, I will help you to find a location where you can have the session.

If you have any further ideas please start a discussion on the {% include mailing_list.html %} - we would like to hear your ideas.
