Happy new year and we start again with our monthly meetups in 2014.

## Talks


* **"Using Vimperator to browse the Web"** by [Matthias Günther](https://twitter.com/wikimatze)

    I switched over to Vimperator one month ago and would like to show you shortcuts and how you can configure it.
* **"Clever autocommands"** by [Andrew Radev](https://twitter.com/andrewradev)

    I'm going to do a quick overview on autocommands and some gotchas in their usage. I assume that most people present will know this stuff already, but there might be one or two things you may not have known before :).

    I'll talk about some clever ways I use autocommands. I'll also show my unfinished experiments with a recently-added autocommand called `TextChanged`. This allows you to hook into any kind of change in both normal and insert mode, with some gotchas...

    I'm hoping that many other attendees will pitch in for ideas about interesting autocommands they use, opening up some discussion after the talk.


## Vim News

This is a new part in our meetup. Andrew will talk about the latest things happening in our Vim community like stuff posted in reddit, discussions on the mailing list, some new plugin or new mapping that someone tweeted. If we get positive feedback about this idea, we make will make this a daily habbit to every following meetup.


If you want to give a talk too, just send us a tweet or a mail.
