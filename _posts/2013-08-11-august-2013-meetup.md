We currently have one talk on our agenda:


<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>"Browsing a codebase with ctags"</strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/wikimatze">Matthias Günther</a>
    <br>
    I was always asking myself how I can browse a code base of bigger written ruby library. I want to share with you
    what I did and what my current work flow looks like.
  </li>
</ul>


You can find this event under [lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/cqtfq).


Please not that this will be our last meetup at the old place of LAUNCH/CO in the Warschauer Straße since they will be
moving to a new place. If you have any ideas how we can thank them for hosting us over 1 1/2 half year, let's discuss it
on [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/vimberlin/).


If you want to give a talk too, just let me know and I can put it on the agenda.
