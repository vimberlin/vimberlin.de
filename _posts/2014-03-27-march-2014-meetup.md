## Recap

This was our first meetup where we had no talks. I couldn't attend so I can only write what I heard from people saying
what they did there:


- [vimrc](https://github.com/wellle/dotfiles/blob/master/vimrc) of [Christian Wellenbrock](https://github.com/wellle) was checked
- talk about [targets.vim](https://github.com/wellle/targets.vim) plugin
- talk about [tmux-complete.vim](https://github.com/wellle/tmux-complete.vim) plugin
- after talking about [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), [Christian Wellenbrock](https://github.com/wellle) made a [commit](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/79321c62d504674d26de1d70a4832cfad7fb976e) for it


Next time, we are going to have talks again.
