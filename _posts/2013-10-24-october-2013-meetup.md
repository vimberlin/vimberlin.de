We will gather around 7pm at the office and will start with the talks around 7.30pm - no need to huzzle around

## We have two talks on our agenda:


* **"Ways to extract certain text-components"** by [Matthias Günther](https://twitter.com/wikimatze)

    There are these days at work where you have to solve certain problem but you know that this isn't the easiest way to
    do it. Let me explain you my thoughts to you.

* **"Fiddling around with indentation"** by [Andrew Radev](https://gist.github.com/AndrewRadev)

    One of the drawbacks I see in indent-based languages like haml or coffeescript is that they can be somewhat hard to manipulate, compared to the ones with closing tags. For the latter ones, we have snippets, endwise.vim, auto-indentation, text objects. Dealing with indent can be trickier.

    I've played around and built some simple tools to help me out. I didn't get too far, but I'd like to show them off regardless, because I think they might be interesting. I'll also demonstrate some interesting plugins on the topic that I know of. I'd love it if the attendees pitch in with their own methods of working with slim, haml, coffeescript or python.


If you want to show us your `vimrc` - you are welcome to do so.


You can find this event under [Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/crqzz).


If you want to give a talk too, just let me know and I can you on the agenda. Just drop us a line on twitter or via
mail.
