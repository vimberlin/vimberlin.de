## Talks

- **"Vim Banshee - a command line wrapper for Banshee"** by [Matthias Günther](https://twitter.com/wikimatze)<br>
Matthias wanted to give a talk about this during the [april 2015 meetup](/april-2015-meetup/ "april 2015 meetup") but
will do it this time. Based on [Ben Klein's](https://twitter.com/fifthposition) book [The VimL Primer: Edit Like a Pro with Vim Plugins and Scripts](https://pragprog.com/book/bkviml/the-viml-primer) I started to write this plugin and I want to go through it
and explain it.

See you all soon.
