![/images/workshop.png](/images/workshop.png "workshop")

Our first beginners workshop in [August 2012](/august-2012-workshop) was a huge success. Around twenty people were
learning something new: Some of them learned the usage of the `vimrc`, others went through
[vimtutor](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/vimtutor1.html), and some of them asked specific questions.

I'm happy to announce the second vimberlin beginners workshop. We will meet on:

<pre>
  October, 25th 2012

{% include three_coaches.html %}


## What else do you need

- Your machine with Vim on it
- Your questions you want to ask
- Maybe a cake so that we can have a break
- Patience

In case some of you want to play [vimgolf](http://vimgolf.com/), please have ruby installed on your system along with
the `vimgolf` gem.

Please be on-time, we won't want to waste time.


## Recap

This time we had fewer people at out workshop since last time: 5 males, 1 female, and three coaches. We changed the
format of this workshop a little bit more and make it more like a talk about the main concepts and features of Vim with
interactive questions of the audience. Other coaches trained new people to Vim individually as we went together through
the **vimtutor**. Again, we got huge positive feedback for our workshop and will try newer things in the future to make
it better.

You can discuss things on our {% include mailing_list.html %} and on {% include twitter_link.html %}. Our coach
[Sven](https://twitter.com/guckes) was so nice to put a resume of the last meetup
[online](http://www.guckes.net/vimberlin/2012-10-25.notes.txt).

If you have any further ideas please start a discussion on our {% include mailing_list.html %} or drop us a line on
[twitter](https://twitter.com/vimberlin) - we would like to hear your ideas.
