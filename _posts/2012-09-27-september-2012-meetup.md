## Recap

First of all: Thanks to the about 20 Vim enthusiasts for coming, thanks to
[LAUNCH/CO](https://launchco.com/etc/#coworking) for providing the space, and
last but not least, thanks to the speakers Gregor Schmidt, Matthias Viehweger,
and Matthias Günther for preparing and giving the talks.

Gregor ([@schmidtwisser](https://twitter.com/schmidtwisser)) explained how
Vimgolfs work and what he learned during solving the [Vertical
Limit](http://vimgolf.com/challenges/50048db8cdc4060002000004) challenge. You
may find his slides on [GitHub](http://schmidt.github.com/talks/2012-09-27/) and

Matthias Viehweger ([@der_kronn](https://twitter.com/der_kronn)) talked in
"Mission Vimpossible - Some things you cannot do in Vim and how to do them there
anyway" about how he uses Vim to create IT-Infrastructure visualization with
Vim, how to make nice favicons in Vim, and how to use hidden buffers to prepare
a presentation. You may find his talk on [vimeo](https://vimeo.com/50492236)
