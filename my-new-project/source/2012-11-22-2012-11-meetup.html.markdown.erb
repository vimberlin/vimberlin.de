### Recap

I loved this meetup today: We had new people giving talks and they did an awesome job. I recored only one talk but next I try to get them all.


Niels Madan ([@nielsmadan](https://twitter.com/nielsmadan)) explained his experiences with creating his own colorscheme:

This month we will not have an beginners workshop and no official meetup in december.
